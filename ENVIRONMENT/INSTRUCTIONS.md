just type:
conda env create -f environment.yml

Then, still need to replace stain_normalizer.py in staintools directory with the custom version found in 'custom_stain_normalizer' directory. Most like under home directory in /home/skobayashi/anaconda3/envs/IHC_HE_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/staintools/

then activate using:
conda activate IHC_HE_env
